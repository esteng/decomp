## Contents

The file `it-happened_eng_ud1.2_10262016.tsv` corresponds to the data reported in White et al. 2016, and the file `it-happened_eng_ud1.2_07092017.tsv` corresponds to the data reported in Rudinger et al. 2018. The latter file contains a strict superset of the data found in the former. Both are stand-off annotations with pointers into the English Web Treebank portion of English Universal Dependencies v1.2. 

The column descriptions and values for `it-happened_eng_ud1.2_10262016.tsv` can be found below. 

| Column            | Description       | Values            |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Split             | The train-dev-test split from the English Web Treebank | `train`, `dev`, `test` |
| Annotator.ID      | The annotator that provided the response | `0`, ..., `23` |
| Display.Position  | The position in which the predicate was displayed in the HIT starting at 1 | `1`, ..., `10`  |
| Sentence.ID       | The file and sentence number of the sentence in the English Universal Dependencies v1.2 treebank with the format `LANGUAGE-CORPUS-SPLIT.ANNOTATION SENTNUM` | see data |
| Pred.Token        | The position of the predicate in the sentence starting at 1 | `1`, ..., `155` |
| Pred.Lemma        | The predicate lemma | see data |
| Is.Predicate      | Whether the word in question is a predicate | `true`, `false` |
| Is.Understandable | Whether the sentence in question is understandable | `true`, `false` |
| Happened          | Whether the eventuality described by the predicate happened or is happening | `yes`, `no`, `nan` |
| Confidence        | How confident the annotator was in the `Happened` judgment | `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `nan` |
